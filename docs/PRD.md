# Solar System Visualization App PRD
## Product Requirements Document
*Version 1.1*

### Overview
The Solar System Visualization App is an interactive, educational web application designed to help children learn about our solar system through a visually engaging and scientifically accurate representation of planets orbiting around the sun.

### Target Audience
- Primary: Children ages 6-12
- Secondary: Teachers and parents using the app as an educational tool

### Problem Statement
Children often struggle to understand abstract astronomical concepts through traditional learning methods. A dynamic, visual representation of the solar system can make these concepts more tangible and engaging.

### Product Goals
1. Create an engaging visual representation of the solar system
2. Educate users about basic astronomical concepts
3. Provide an intuitive and child-friendly user interface
4. Ensure scientific accuracy while maintaining simplicity

### Key Features

#### 1. Solar System Visualization
- Interactive 3D representation of the solar system
- Sun positioned at the center of the screen
- All eight planets displayed in their respective orbital rings
- Continuous orbital animation of planets around the sun
- Proper relative sizing of planets (scaled appropriately for visibility)
- Distinct colors and textures for each celestial body

#### 2. Planet Information
- Basic information displayed when hovering over or clicking on a planet:
  - Planet name
  - Planet type (rocky/gas giant)
  - Distance from the sun
  - One fun fact about the planet

#### 3. Interactive Elements
- Ability to pause/play planet rotation
- Simple zoom functionality to focus on specific planets
- Smooth animations for engaging user experience
- Camera focus on selected planets with automatic zoom and centering
- Ability to return to full solar system view

#### 4. Educational Components
- Simple labels for all celestial bodies
- Basic orbital paths shown as rings
- Color-coded elements for easy identification

#### 5. Visual Effects
- Realistic sun glow with light emission
- Star field background with subtle movement
- Atmospheric effects for planets
- Highlight effects for interactive elements

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend Technologies
- React.js for the user interface
- Three.js with React Three Fiber for 3D visualization
- HTML5 Canvas or SVG for animations
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

#### Performance Requirements
- Smooth animations at 60fps
- Initial load time under 3 seconds
- Support for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Optimized 3D assets for mobile devices

### User Interface Requirements
- Clean, modern design with a dark background (space theme)
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Large, readable text for children
- Simple, intuitive controls
- Minimal UI elements to avoid distraction
- Smooth transitions between views and states

### Future Enhancements (v2.0)
1. Addition of moons for each planet
2. More detailed planet information
3. Educational mini-games
4. Sound effects and background music
5. 3D visualization option
6. Advanced post-processing effects (bloom, ambient occlusion)
7. Realistic planet textures and surface details
8. Time-based visualization (day/night cycles, seasons)

### Success Metrics
1. User engagement time
2. Educational value (through user feedback)
3. Smooth performance across devices
4. Positive user feedback from children and educators

### Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic solar system visualization (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Interactive features and educational content (1 week)
- Phase 3: Camera controls and focus features (1 week)
- Phase 4: Visual enhancements and effects (1 week)
- Phase 5: Testing and refinement (1 week)
- Total: 6 weeks

### Constraints
- Must maintain scientific accuracy while being visually appealing
- Performance optimization for smooth animations
- Simplified UI to avoid overwhelming young users
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color blind friendly design
- Pause functionality for reduced motion sensitivity

This PRD will guide the development of our Solar System Visualization App, ensuring we create an engaging and educational tool for young learners.
